Background
In the world of capital projects, many organizations have the need to formally manage the
financial terms of the contracts that they enter into. It is a direct and straightforward way to get a
sense of how much money has been spent on a project, and how much money is expected to
be received by the organization performing the work. Typically, this area is called Contract Management.

Contract managers have several areas of interest:
● Budgets (how much money did I expect to spend/receive)
● Commitments (how much money have I committed to spending/receiving)
● Forecasts (how much money in the future will I have to spend/receive)
● Payments (how much money has actually left/arrived in my bank account)

The combination of these items is sufficient to get a sense of the performance of the project
from a financial perspective.
